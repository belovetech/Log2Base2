# Graph Data Structure

A graph data structure is a collection of edges and vertices. Vertices also called Nodes. G = (V , E)

## Types of Graphs direction

- Directed Graph
- Unidirected Graph

## Two types of Degree

- In-degree - edges going to of vertex
- Out-degree - edges coming out of vertex

## Two Methods of Graph representation

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

## Types of Graphs and suitable graph methods

- Dense Graph - Adjacency Matrix
- Sparse Graph - Adjacency List
