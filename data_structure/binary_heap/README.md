# Binary heap

Binary heap is a priority queue. binary heap is a complete tree which satisfying the heap ordering priority

A complete tree ia a full tree in which the last level may contain lesser nodes but should be as left as possible.

## Two kinds of heap

- Min heap - The node with the minimum value will be at the root so it can be accessible at constant time O(1)

- Max heap - The node with the maximum value will be at the root o it can be accessible at constant time O(1)

## Formular to find left and right node

- left node = `2 * i + 1`
- right node = `2 * i + 2`
