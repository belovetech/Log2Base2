# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

- Time Complexity - O(n2)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
- Auxilliary space - O(1)

## insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

- Time Complexity - O(n2)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
- Auxilliary space - O(1)

## Bubble sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

- Time Complexity - O(n2)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
- Auxilliary space - O(1)

## Heap sort

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

- Time Complexity - O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
- Auxilliary space - O(1)

## Quick sort

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

- Time Complexity - O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
- Auxilliary space - O(1)

## Merge sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

- Time Complexity - O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
- Auxilliary space - O(n)
